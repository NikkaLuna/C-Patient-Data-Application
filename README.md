# Patient Data C++ Application

This program takes a list of patient data and uses function calls to manipulate the data.

# Patient Data Management System


While parsing the data list, the program creates patient objects.

Accessor functions access the member variables of the Patient class. Mutator functions are used to control changes to the variables.

The entire patient list is stored in one array of patients called PatientRosterArray.

This program defines an enumerated data type 'Hospitaldepartment' containing the data type values NEUROLOGY, ONCOLOGY, and CARDIOLOGY.

## Functions

- `remove()`: Removes patients from the roster by patient ID. If the patient ID does not exist, the function prints an error message indicating that the patient was not found.

- `printAll()`: Prints a complete tab-separated list of patient data. The `printAll()` function loops through all the patients in PatientRosterArray and calls the `print()` function for each patient.

- `printAverageDaysInHospital()`: Prints the average number of days a patient has stayed in the hospital, with three individual stays to derive an average from.

- `printInvalidEmails()`: Verifies patient email addresses and displays all invalid email addresses to the user.

- `printByHospitalDepartment()`: Prints out patient information that specifies which hospital department the patient is staying in.

## Environment

This program was created in Xcode version 13.3.1.
